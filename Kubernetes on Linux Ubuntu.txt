Kubernetes is a cluster management tool. If comparing to Docker and Ansible, I split it up in the following:

Docker: The container
Ansible: A tool you can use to script out docker containers. You can also use the dockerfile, though i'm going down the Ansible route as i see it as more open
Kubernetes: A cluster management tool. I see this as the software that manages the hardware. Your Ansible configuration then uses the Kubernetes cluster to deploy docker containers on for example.

Minikube allows you to set up a single K8 node cluster as a development environment on your machine

# -------
# Step 1: Update system
# Run the following commands to update all system packages to the latest release:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get upgrade

# -------
# Step 2: Install KVM or VirtualBox Hypervisor
# For VirtualBox users, install VirtualBox using:

sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack

# -------
# Step 3: Download minikube
# You need to download the minikube binary. I will put the binary under /usr/local/bin directory since it is inside $PATH.

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
chmod +x minikube-linux-amd64
sudo mv minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# -------
# Step 4: Install kubectl on Ubuntu / Debian
# We need kubectl which is a command line tool used to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
kubectl version -o json


# -------
# Step 5: Starting minikube
# Now that components are installed, you can start minikube. VM image will be downloaded and configure d for Kubernetes single node cluster.

minikube start

-------
# Step 6: Minikube Basic operations
# To check cluster status, run:

kubectl cluster-info

# Kubernetes master is running at https://192.168.39.117:8443
# KubeDNS is running at https://192.168.39.117:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

# To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
# Note that Minikube configuration file is located under ~/.minikube/machines/minikube/config.json

# To View Config, use:

kubectl config view
