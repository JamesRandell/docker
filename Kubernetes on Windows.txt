Kubernetes is a cluster management tool. If comparing to Docker and Ansible, I split it up in the following:

Docker: The container
Ansible: A tool you can use to script out docker containers. You can also use the dockerfile, though i'm going down the Ansible route as i see it as more open
Kubernetes: A cluster management tool. I see this as the software that manages the hardware. Your Ansible configuration then uses the Kubernetes cluster to deploy docker containers on for example.

You need VirtualBox or Hyper-V
I've got HyperV already installed due to having WSL on my Windows 10 Home PC. Typing 'systeminfo' into a command prompt will show this (it'll be at the bottom under "Hyper-V Requirements")

# The rest is really straight forward for Windows. I didn't use the package manager forthis (Chocolatey) and just went direct for the exe download

# You'll need to close and re-open a CMD window to load the update system PATH to run minikube commands.
# Once done, you can:

minikube start

# This will download the neccesary image files to run the kube.
# Once minikube start finishes, run the command below to check the status of the cluster:

minikube status

# If your cluster is running, the output from minikube status should be similar to:

# host: Running
# kubelet: Running
# apiserver: Running
# kubeconfig: Configured
